# Number Formatter
A simple Python script that formats numbers by adding comma separators every three digits (thousands separator).  
The program continuously asks the user for a number and displays the formatted result.  

## Usage
Run the script and enter a number when prompted. The output will be displayed with comma separators.

### Example:
Enter a Number: 123456789
123,456,789

## Features:
âœ… Works in an infinite loop until a valid number is entered  
âœ… Reverses the input, processes it, and then reverses it back for correct formatting  
âœ… Does not use built-in formatting functions (`f"{:,}"`), but instead implements the logic manually
